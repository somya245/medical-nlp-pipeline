I\u2019m doing better, but I still have some discomfort now and then.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *I understand you were in a car accident last September. Can you walk me through what happened?*\n    \n    **Patient:** *Yes, it was on September 1st, around 12:30 in the afternoon. I was driving from Cheadle Hulme to Manchester when I had to stop in traffic. Out of nowhere, another car hit me from behind, which pushed my car into the one in front.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *That sounds like a strong impact. Were you wearing your seatbelt?*\n    \n    **Patient:** *Yes, I always do.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *What did you feel immediately after the accident?*\n    \n    **Patient:** *At first, I was just shocked. But then I realized I had hit my head on the steering wheel, and I could feel pain in my neck and back almost right away.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *Did you seek medical attention at that time?*\n    \n    **Patient:** *Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency. They checked me over and said it was a whiplash injury, but they didn\u2019t do any X-rays. They just gave me some advice and sent me home.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *How did things progress after that?*\n    \n    **Patient:** *The first four weeks were rough. My neck and back pain were really bad\u2014I had trouble sleeping and had to take painkillers regularly. It started improving after that, but I had to go through ten sessions of physiotherapy to help with the stiffness and discomfort.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?*\n    \n    **Patient:** *It\u2019s not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It\u2019s nothing like before, though.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *That\u2019s good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?*\n    \n    **Patient:** *No, nothing like that. I don\u2019t feel nervous driving, and I haven\u2019t had any emotional issues from the accident.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *And how has this impacted your daily life? Work, hobbies, anything like that?*\n    \n    **Patient:** *I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn\u2019t really stopped me from doing anything.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *That\u2019s encouraging. Let\u2019s go ahead and do a physical examination to check your mobility and any lingering pain.*\n    \n    [**Physical Examination Conducted**]\n    \n    **Physician:** *Everything looks good. Your neck and back have a full range of movement, and there\u2019s no tenderness or signs of lasting damage. Your muscles and spine seem to be in good condition.*\n    \n    **Patient:** *That\u2019s a relief!*\n    \n    **Physician:** *Yes, your recovery so far has been quite positive. Given your progress, I\u2019d expect you to make a full recovery within six months of the accident. There are no signs of long-term damage or degeneration.*\n    \n    **Patient:** *That\u2019s great to hear. So, I don\u2019t need to worry about this affecting me in the future?*\n    \n    **Physician:** *That\u2019s right. I don\u2019t foresee any long-term impact on your work or daily life. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, you can always come back for a follow-up. But at this point, you\u2019re on track for a full recovery.*\n    \n    **Patient:** *Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.*\n    \n    **Physician:** *You\u2019re very welcome, Ms. Jones.
